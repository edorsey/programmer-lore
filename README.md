## Twitter SQL Query Fail Whale

> So storytime! I worked at Twitter as a contractor in 2008 (my job was to make internal hockey-stick graphs of usage to impress investors) during the Fail Whale era. The site would go down pretty much daily, and every time the ops team brought it back up, Twitter's VCs would send over a few bottles of really fancy imported Belgian beer (the kind with elaborate wire bottle caps that tell you it's expensive).
> 
> I would intercept these rewards and put them in my backpack for the bus ride home, in order to avoid creating perverse incentives for the operations team. But did anyone call me 'hero'?
> 
> Also at that time, I remember asking the head DB guy about a specific metric, and he ran a live query against the database in front of me. It took a while to return, so he used the time to explain how, in an ordinary setup, the query would have locked all the tables and brought down the entire site, but he was using special SQL-fu to make it run transparently.
> 
> We got so engrossed in the details of this topic that half an hour passed before we noticed that everyone had stopped working and was running around in a frenzy. Someone finally ran over and asked him if he was doing a query, he hit Control-C, and Twitter came back up.

> “Great,” Wayne said, “you’ve got the job! Can you start now?”
> 
> “I guess,” Ben said, a bit confused. It was 3:03PM – exactly three minutes after starting the interview – and Ben didn’t have any other plans for that afternoon. “Let’s, uh, get started?”
>
> “Perfect!” Wayne said enthusiastically. “Okay, so first and foremost, this will be the easiest job you’ve ever done. Really, we don’t need any extra help, but since another contractor just left, we had to fill in the void. You know how that goes, right?”


## A Conspiracy to Kill IE6

> We began collectively fantasizing about how we could exact our revenge on IE6. One idea rose to the surface that quickly captured everyone’s attention. Instead of outright dropping IE6 support, what if we just threatened to? How would users react? Would they revolt against YouTube? Would they mail death threats to our team like had happened in the past? Or would they suddenly become loud advocates of modern browsers?
